Current projects:

- Privacy-preserving Detection of Violence in Cameras
Writing a privacy product specification for a privacy-preserving neural network for video analysis as part of my capstone for the [OpenMined course](https://courses.openmined.org/courses), "Our Privacy Opportunity." 
  [Privacy-Preserving Violence Detector](https://github.com/ARMargolis/priv_violence_detector/blob/main/README.md)
  
- Mean Shift Analysis of the Uniform Crime Reporting data published by the FBI.
I use TensorFlow 2.0 to do the analysis and bokeh to create the map.

  - [crime_us_map.html](/crime_analysis/crime_us_map.html)
  
- Better Bin Packing Through Matrix Multiplication
Using matrix multiplication to speed up a classic optimization problem
  [Latest Version](matrix_bin_packing/Matrix_Bin_Packing_v2.ipynb

Previous projects:
- Optimizing Sailor Health for NavalX's Hack The Machine.
Part of second place finish in Data Science Track. Wrote code for [Challenge 3: Optimizing Sailor Health](https://github.com/ARMargolis/Track2_Challenges_Data/tree/main/Challenge3)


- Pruned Neural Networks for Melanoma Detection
Competing in Kaggle's [Melanoma Detection Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/siim-isic-melanoma-classification/data) through application of the [Lottery Ticket Hypothesis](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.03635.pdf) for neural network pruning.
Secondary goal of building more explainable artificial intelligence. [Repo here](https://github.com/ARMargolis/melanoma-pytorch)

- Quantum Computing for Network Analysis
A proof-of-concept for identifying likely asymptomatic CoVID-19 carriers through network analysis by applying simulated quantum computing with qiskit. Entry into Qiskit Community Summer Jam 2020 https://qiskit-community-summer-jam-new-england.hackerearth.com/

Future plans:

- [AI4EO Air Quality and Health Challenge](https://platform.ai4eo.eu/challenge/air-quality-and-health)
  
- Recursively defined sparse matrices
A new way to build, add, and multiply sparse matrixes for graph neural networks and pruning
